                           SMTP TLS Reporting
                     draft-ietf-uta-smtp-tlsrpt-00

Abstract

   SMTP Mail Transfer Agents often conduct encrypted communication
   through the use of Transport Layer Security (TLS).  Because the
   STARTTLS protocol employs opportunistic encryption, "Man-in-the-
   Middle" intermediaries can interfere with the successful
   establishment of suitable encryption in ways that may not be
   detectable by the receiving server.  This document provides
   transparency into failures in SMTP MTA Strict Transport Security
   (TODO: Add ref), STARTTLS [RFC3207], and the DNS-Based Authentication
   of Named Entities (DANE, [RFC6698]).

1.  Introduction

   The STARTTLS extension to SMTP [RFC3207] allows SMTP clients and
   hosts to establish secure SMTP sessions over TLS.  The protocol
   design is based on "Opportunistic Security" (OS) [RFC7435], which
   provides interoperability for clients that do not support it, but
   means that any attacker who can delete parts of the SMTP session
   (such as the "250 STARTTLS" response) or who can redirect the entire
   SMTP session (perhaps by overwriting the resolved MX record of the
   delivery domain) can perform such a downgrade or interception attack.

   Because such "downgrade attacks" are not necessarily apparent to the
   receiving MTA, this document defines a mechanism for sending domains
   to report on failures at multiple parts of the MTA-to-MTA
   conversation.

   Specifically, this document defines a reporting schema that covers
   failures in routing, STARTTLS negotiation, and both DANE [RFC7671]
   and STS (TODO: Add ref) policy validation errors.

   Implementers establish a policy by publishing a TXT record in the DNS
   which instructs compliant sending MTAs to deliver reports of delivery
   and STARTTLS failures in the appropriate format to the specified
   endpoint.

   This document is intended as a companion to the specification for
   SMTP MTA Strict Transport Security (MTA-STS, TODO: Add ref).

1.1.  Terminology

   The keywords MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL, SHALL NOT, SHOULD,
   SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL, when they appear in this
   document, are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   We also define the following terms for further use in this document:

   o  STS Policy: A definition of the expected TLS availability and
      behavior, as well as the desired actions for a given domain when a
      sending MTA encounters different results.

   o  TLSRPT Policy: A policy detailing the endpoint for sending MTAs
      should to deliver reports

   o  Policy Domain: The domain against which an STS Policy is defined.

   o  Sending MTA: The MTA initiating the delivery of an email message.

2.  Related Technologies

   o  This document is intended as a companion to the specification for
      SMTP MTA Strict Transport Security (MTA-STS, TODO: Add ref).

   o  The Public Key Pinning Extension for HTTP [RFC7469] contains a
      JSON-based definition for reporting individual pin validation
      failures.

   o  The Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and
      Conformance (DMARC) [RFC7489] contains an XML-based reporting
      format for aggregate and detailed email delivery errors.

3.  Reporting Policy

   SMTP TLSRPT policies are distributed via DNS from the Policy Domain's
   zone, either through a new resource record, or as TXT records
   (similar to DMARC policies) under the name "_smtp_tlsrpt".  (Current
   implementations deploy as TXT records.)  For example, for the Policy
   Domain "example.com", the recipient's SMTP STS policy can be
   retrieved from "_smtp_tlsrpt.example.com".

   (Future implementations may move to alternate methods of policy
   discovery or distribution.  See the section _Future_ _Work_ for more
   discussion.)

   Policies consist of the following directives:

   o  "v": This value MUST be equal to "TLSRPT1".

   o  "rua": A URI specifying the endpoint to which aggregate
      information about policy failures should be sent (see the section
      _Reporting Schema_ for more information).  Two URI schemes are
      supported: "mailto" and "https".

      *  In the case of "https", reports should be submitted via POST
         ([RFC2818]) to the specified URI.

      *  In the case of "mailto", reports should be submitted to the
         specified email address.  When sending failure reports via
         SMTP, sending MTAs MUST NOT honor SMTP STS or DANE TLSA
         failures.

   o  "ruf": Future use.  (There may also be a need for enabling more
      detailed "forensic" reporting during initial stages of a
      deployment.  To address this, the authors consider the possibility
      of an optional additional "forensic reporting mode" in which more
      details--such as certificate chains and MTA banners--may be
      reported.  See the section _Future_ _Work_ for more details.)

3.1.  Example Reporting Policy

3.1.1.  Report using MAILTO:

   ```_smtp_tlsrpt.mail.example.com.  IN TXT
   "v:TLSRPT1;rua:mailto:reports@example.com"

           ### Report using HTTPS:

           ```_smtp_tlsrpt.mail.example.com. IN TXT \
                   "v:TLSRPT1; \
                   rua:https://reporting.example.com/v1/tlsrpt"

4.  Reporting Schema

   Aggregate reports contain the following fields:

   o  _Report metadata_:

      *  The organization responsible for the report

      *  Contact information for one or more responsible parties for the
         contents of the report

      *  A unique identifier for the report

      *  The reporting date range for the report

   o  _Policy_, consisting of:

      *  One of the following policy types:

         +  The SMTP MTA STS policy applied (as a string)

         +  The DANE TLSA record applied (as a string)

         +  The literal string "no-policy-found", if neither a TLSA nor
            MTA-STS policy could be found.

      *  The domain for which the policy is applied

      *  The MX host

      *  An identifier for the policy (where applicable)

   o  _Aggregate counts_, comprising _result type_, _sending MTA IP_,
      _receiving MTA hostname_, _message count_, and an optional
      _additional information_ field containing a URI for recipients to
      review further information on a failure type.

   Note that the failure types are non-exclusive; an aggregate report
   MAY contain overlapping "counts" of failure types where a single send
   attempt encountered multiple errors.

4.1.  Result Types

   The list of result types will start with the minimal set below, and
   is expected to grow over time based on real-world experience.  The
   initial set is:

4.1.1.  Success Type

   o  "success": This indicates that the sending MTA was able to
      successfully negotiate a policy-compliant TLS connection, and
      serves to provide a "heartbeat" to receiving domains that
      reporting is functional and tabulating correctly.

4.1.2.  Routing Failures

   o  "mx-mismatch": This indicates that the MX resolved for the
      recipient domain did not match the MX constraint specified in the
      policy.

   o  "certificate-mismatch": This indicates that the certificate
      presented by the receiving MX did not match the MX hostname

4.1.3.  Negotiation Failures

   o  "starttls-not-supported": This indicates that the recipient MX did
      not support STARTTLS.

   o  "invalid-certificate": This indicates that the certificate
      presented by the receiving MX did not validate.

   o  "certificate-mismatch": This indicates that the certificate
      presented did not adhere to the constraints specified in the STS
      or DANE policy, e.g. if the CN field did not match the hostname of
      the MX.

   o  "expired-certificate": This indicates that the certificate has
      expired.

4.1.4.  Policy Failures

4.1.4.1.  DANE-specific Policy Failures

   o  "tlsa-invalid": This indicates a validation error in the TLSA
      record associated with a DANE policy.

   o  "dnssec-invalid": This indicates a failure to authenticate DNS
      records for a Policy Domain with a published TLSA record.

Internet-Draft                 SMTP-TLSRPT                    April 2016


4.1.4.2.  STS-specific Policy Failures

   o  "sts-invalid": This indicates a validation error for the overall
      MTA-STS policy.

   o  "webpki-invalid": This indicates that the MTA-STS policy could not
      be authenticated using PKIX validation.

5.  IANA Considerations

   There are no IANA considerations at this time.

6.  Security Considerations

   SMTP TLS Reporting provides transparency into misconfigurations and
   attempts to intercept or tamper with mail between hosts who support
   STARTTLS.  There are several security risks presented by the
   existence of this reporting channel:

   o  _Flooding of the Aggregate report URI (rua) endpoint_: An attacker
      could flood the endpoint and prevent the receiving domain from
      accepting additional reports.  This type of Denial-of-Service
      attack would limit visibility into STARTTLS failures, leaving the
      receiving domain blind to an ongoing attack.

   o  _Untrusted content_: An attacker could inject malicious code into
      the report, opening a vulnerability in the receiving domain.
      Implementers are advised to take precautions against evaluating
      the contents of the report.

   o  _Report snooping_: An attacker could create a bogus TLSRPT record
      to receive statistics about a domain the attacker does not own.
      Since an attacker able to poison DNS is already able to receive
      counts of SMTP connections (and, in fact, actual SMTP message
      payloads) today, this does not present a significant new
      vulnerability.
