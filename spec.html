<p>— abstract <br>
SMTP STS is a mechanism enabling mail service providers to declare their ability to receive TLS-secured connections, and to request sending SMTP servers to, when delivering mail destined for the recipient domain, require TLS encryption, with specified mechanisms for certificate validation, and/or to report TLS negotiation failures.</p>

<h1 id="1-introduction">1.  Introduction</h1>

<p>The STARTTLS extension to SMTP [RFC3207] allows SMTP clients and hosts to establish secure SMTP sessions over TLS.  In its current form, however, it fails to provide (a) message confidentiality – because opportunistic STARTTLS is subject to downgrade attacks – and (b) server authenticity – because the trust relationship from email domain to MTA server identity is not cryptographically validated. </p>

<p>While such “opportunistic” encryption protocols provide a high barrier against passive man-in-the-middle traffic interception, any attacker who can delete parts of the SMTP session (such as the “250 STARTTLS” response) or who can redirect the entire SMTP session (perhaps by overwriting the resolved MX record of the delivery domain) can perform such a downgrade or interception attack.</p>

<p>This document defines a mechanism for recipient domains to publish policies specifying: </p>

<ul>
<li>whether MTAs sending mail to this domain should expect TLS support</li>
<li>how MTAs can validate the TLS server certificate presented during mail delivery </li>
<li>what the recipient recommends should be done with messages when TLS cannot be successfully negotiated</li>
</ul>

<p>The protocol described is separated into three logical components: </p>

<ol>
<li>policy semantics: whether senders can expect a receiving server for the recipient domain to support TLS encryption, how to validate the TLS certificate presented, and what to do in case of failures </li>
<li>failure report format: a mechanism for informing recipient domains about aggregate failure statistics </li>
<li>policy authentication: how to determine the authenticity of a published policy delivered via DNS</li>
</ol>

<h1 id="5-related-technologies"> 5.  Related Technologies</h1>

<p>The DANE TLSA record {{!RFC7672}} is similar, in that DANE is also designed to upgrade opportunistic encryption into required encryption.  DANE requires DNSSEC {{!RFC4033}} for the secure delivery of policies; the protocol described here presents a variant for systems not yet supporting DNSSEC.</p>

<h2 id="21-differences-from-dane">2.1.  Differences from DANE</h2>

<p>The primary difference between the protocol described here and DANE is that DANE requires the use of DNSSEC to authenticate DANE TLSA records, whereas SMTP STS relies on the certificate authority (CA) system and a trust-on-first-use (TOFU) approach to avoid interception.  The TOFU model allows a degree of security similar to that of HPKP [RFC7469], omitting both the complexity and the guarantees on first use offered by DNSSEC.  (For a thorough discussion of this trade-off, see the section <em>Threat</em> <em>Model</em>.) </p>

<p>In addition, SMTP STS introduces a mechanism for failure reporting and a report-only mode, enabling progressive roll-out and auditing for compliance. </p>



<h2 id="22-advantages-when-used-with-dane">2.2.  Advantages When Used with DANE</h2>

<p>SMTP STS can be deployed for a recipient domain that also publishes a DANE TLSA record for SMTP.  In these cases, the SMTP STS policy can additionally declare a process for failure reporting.</p>



<h2 id="23-advantages-when-used-without-dane">2.3.  Advantages When Used Without DANE</h2>

<p>When deployed without a DANE TLSA record, SMTP STS offers the following advantages compared to DANE:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Infrastructure:</em> In comparison to DANE, this proposal does not require DNSSEC be deployed on either the sending or receiving domain.  In addition, the reporting feature of SMTP STS can be deployed to perform offline analysis of STARTTLS failures, enabling mail providers to gain insight into the security of their SMTP connections without the need to modify MTA codebases directly.</li>
<li><em>Incrementalism:</em> DANE does not provide a reporting mechanism, nor does it have a concept of “report-only” failures; as a result, a service provider has no choice but to “flip the switch” and affect the entire mail stream at once.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="24-disadvantages-when-used-without-dane">2.4.  Disadvantages When Used Without DANE</h2>

<p>When deployed alone (i.e. without a DANE record, and using Web PKI for certificate verification), SMTP STS offers the following disadvantages compared to DANE:</p>

<ul>
<li>Infrastructure: DANE may be easier for some providers to deploy. In particular, for providers who already support DNSSEC, SMTP STS would additionally require they obtain a CA-signed x509 certificate for the recipient domain.</li>
<li>Security: DANE offers an advantage against policy-lookup DoS attacks; that is, while a DNSSEC-signed NX response to a DANE lookup authoritatively indicates the lack of a DANE record, such an option to authenticate policy non-existence does not exist when looking up a policy over plain DNS.</li>
</ul>



<h1 id="3-threat-model">3.  Threat Model</h1>

<p>SMTP Strict Transport Security protects against an active attacker who wishes to intercept or tamper with mail between hosts who support STARTTLS.  There are two classes of attacks considered:</p>

<ul>
<li>Foiling TLS negotiation, for example by deleting the “250 STARTTLS” response from a server or altering TLS session negotiation.  This would result in the SMTP session occurring over plaintext, despite both parties supporting TLS.</li>
<li>Impersonating the destination mail server, whereby the sender might deliver the message to an impostor, who could then monitor and/or modify messages despite opportunistic TLS.  This impersonation could be accomplished by spoofing the DNS MX record for the recipient domain, or by redirecting client connections to the legitimate recipient server (for example, by altering BGP routing tables). </li>
</ul>

<p>SMTP Strict Transport Security relies on certificate validation via either TLS identity checking [RFC6125] or DANE TLSA [RFC7672]. Attackers who are able to obtain a valid certificate for the targeted recipient mail service (e.g. by compromising a certificate authority) are thus out of scope of this threat model.</p>

<h1 id="4-policy-semantics">4.  Policy Semantics</h1>

<p>SMTP STS policies are distributed at the recipient domain either through a new resource record, or as TXT records (similar to DMARC policies) under the name “_smtp_sts.”  [Current implementations deploy as TXT records.]  For example, for the recipient domain “example.com”, the recipient’s SMTP STS policy can be retrieved from “_smtp_sts.example.com.” </p>

<p>Policies must specify the following fields:</p>

<ul>
<li>v: Version (plain-text, required).  Currently only “1” is supported.</li>
<li>to: TLS-Only (plain-text, required).  If “true,” the receiving MTA requests that messages be delivered only if they conform to the STS policy.</li>
<li>mx: MX patterns (comma-separated list of plain-text MX match patterns, required).  One or more comma-separated patterns matching the expected MX for this domain.  For example, “<em>.example.com,</em>.example.net” indicates that mail for this domain might be handled by any MX whose hostname is a subdomain of “example.com” or “example.net.”</li>
<li>a: The mechanism to use to authenticate this policy itself.  See the section <em>Policy</em> <em>Authentication</em> for more details.  Possible values are: <br>
<ul><li>webpki:URI, where URI points to an HTTPS resource at the recipient domain that serves the same policy text.</li>
<li>dnssec: Indicating that the policy is expected to be served over DNSSEC.</li></ul></li>
<li>c: Constraints on the recipient MX’s TLS certificate (plain-text, required).  See the section <em>Policy</em> <em>Validation</em> for more details.  Possible values are: <br>
<ul><li>webpki: Indicating that the TLS certificate presented by the recipient MX must be valid according to the “web PKI” mechanism.</li>
<li>tlsa: Indicating that the TLS certificate presented by the recipient MX must match a (presumed to exist) DANE TLSA record.</li></ul></li>
<li>e: Max lifetime of the policy (plain-text integer seconds).  Well-behaved clients should cache a policy for up to this value from last policy fetch time.</li>
<li>rua: Address to which aggregate feedback should be sent (comma-separated plain-text list of email addresses, optional).  For example, “mailto:postmaster@example.com”.</li>
<li>ruf: Address to which detailed forensic reports should be sent</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="5-policy-expirations">5.  Policy Expirations</h1>

<p>In order to resist attackers inserting a fraudulent policy, SMTP STS policies are designed to be long-lived, with an expiry typically greater than two weeks.  Policy validity is controlled by two separate expiration times: the lifetime indicated in the policy (“e=”) and the TTL on the DNS record itself.  The policy expiration will ordinarily be longer than that of the DNS TTL, and senders should cache a policy (and apply it to all mail to the recipient domain) until the policy expiration. <br>
An important consideration for domains publishing a policy is that senders may potentially see a policy expiration as relative to the fetch of a policy cached by their recursive resolver.  Consequently, a sender may treat a policy as valid for up to {expiration time} + {DNS TTL}. Publishers should thus continue to expect senders to apply old policies for up to this duration.</p>



<h1 id="6-failure-reporting">6.  Failure Reporting</h1>

<p>Aggregate statistics on policy failures should be reported to the URI indicated in the “rua” field of the policy.  SMTP STS reports contain information about policy failures to allow diagnosis of misconfigurations and malicious activity.  These are verbose, and may not be desirable in regular production.  Aggregate reports contain tallies of policy failures, and are more appropriate for regular use. </p>

<p>Aggregate reports contain the following fields:</p>

<ul>
<li>The SMTP STS policy applied (as a string)</li>
<li>The beginning and end of the reporting period</li>
</ul>

<p>Repeated records contain the following fields:</p>

<ul>
<li>Failure type: This list will start with the minimal set below, and is expected to grow over time based on real-world experience.  The initial set is:</li>
<li>mx-mismatch: This indicates that the MX resolved for the recipient domain did not match the MX constraint specified in the policy.</li>
<li>certificate-mismatch: This indicates that the certificate presented by the receiving MX did not match the MX hostname</li>
<li>invalid-certificate: This indicates that the certificate presented by the receiving MX did not validate according to the policy validation constraint.  (Either it was not signed by a trusted CA or did not match the DANE TLSA record for the recipient MX.) o  expired-certificate: This indicates that the certificate has expired.</li>
<li>starttls-not-supported: This indicates that the recipient MX did not support STARTTLS.</li>
<li>Count: The number of times the error was encountered.</li>
<li>Hostname: The hostname of the recipient MX.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that the failure types are non-exclusive; an aggregate report may contain overlapping counts of failure types where a single send attempt encountered multiple errors. When sending failure reports, sending MTAs should not honor SMTP STS or DANE TLSA failures.</p>

<h1 id="7-policy-authentication">7.  Policy Authentication</h1>

<p>The security of a domain implementing an SMTP STS policy against an active man-in-the-middle depends primarily upon the long-lived caching of policies.  However, to allow recipient domains to safely serve new policies <em>prior</em> to the expiration of a cached policy, and to prevent long-term (either malicious or active) denials of service, it is important that senders are able to validate a new policy  retrieved for a recipient domain.  There are two supported mechanisms for policy validation:</p>

<ul>
<li>Web PKI: In this mechanism, indicated by the “webpki” value of the “a” field, the sender fetches a HTTPS resource from the URI indicated.  For example, “a=webpki:<a href="https://example.com/.well-">https://example.com/.well-</a> known/smtp_sts/current” indicates that the sender should fetch the resource <a href="https://example.com/.well-known/smtp_sts/current">https://example.com/.well-known/smtp_sts/current</a>.  The HTTP response body served at this resource must exactly match the policy initially loaded via the DNS TXT method, and must be served from an HTTPS endpoint at the domain matching that of the recipient domain. <br>
(<em>TODO:</em> As this RFC standard progresses, the authors will register .well-known/smtp-sts.  See [RFC5785]. Then implementers will NOT specify a URI, but rather rely on the .well-known URL)</li>
<li>DNSSEC: In this mechanism, indicated by the “dnssec” value of the “a” field, the sender must retrieve the policy via a DNSSEC signed response for the <em>smtp_sts TXT record. When fetching a new policy when one is not already known, or when fetching a policy for a domain with an expired policy, unauthenticated policies should be trusted and honored.  When fetching a policy and authenticating it, as described in detail in _Policy</em> <em>Application</em>, policies will be authenticated using the mechanism specified by the existing cached policy. Note, however, as described in detail in <em>Policy</em> <em>Application</em>, that new policies should not be considered as valid if they do not validate on first application.  That is, a freshly fetched (and unused) policy that has not successfully been applied should be disregarded.</li>
</ul>



<h1 id="8-policy-validation">8.  Policy Validation</h1>

<p>When sending to an MX at a domain for which the sender has a valid and non-expired SMTP STS policy, a sending MTA honoring SMTP STS should validate that the recipient MX supports STARTTLS and offers a TLS certificate which is valid according to the semantics of the SMTP STS policy.  Policies can specify certificate validity in one of two ways by setting the value of the “c” field in the policy description. o  Web PKI: When the “c” field is set to “webpki”, the certificate presented by the receiving MX must be valid for the MX name and chain to a root CA that is trusted by the sending MTA.  The certificate must have a CN or SAN matching the MX hostname (as described in [RFC6125]) and be non-expired.</p>

<ul>
<li>DANE TLSA: When the “c” field is set to “tlsa”, the receiving MX should be covered by a DANE TLSA record for the recipient domain, and the presented certificate should be valid according to that record (as described by [RFC7672]).</li>
</ul>



<h1 id="9-policy-application">9.  Policy Application</h1>

<p>When sending to an MX at a domain for which the sender has a valid non-expired SMTP STS policy, a sending MTA honoring SMTP STS can apply the result of a policy validation one of two ways:</p>

<ul>
<li>Report-only: In this mode, sending MTAs merely send a report to the designated report address indicating policy application failures.  This can be done “offline”, i.e. based on the MTA logs, and is thus a suitable low-risk option for MTAs who wish to enhance transparency of TLS tampering without making complicated changes to production mail-handling infrastructure.</li>
<li>Enforced: In this mode, sending MTAs should treat STS policy failures, in which the policy action is “reject”, as a mail delivery error, and should terminate the SMTP connection, not delivering any more mail to the recipient MTA. <br>
In enforced mode, however, sending MTAs should first check for a new <em>authenticated</em> policy before actually treating a message failure as fatal. <br>
Thus the control flow for a sending MTA that does online policy application consists of the following steps: <br>
<ol><li>Check for cached non-expired policy.  If none exists, fetch the latest and cache it.</li>
<li>Validate recipient MTA against policy.  If valid, deliver mail. </li>
<li>If policy invalid and policy specifies reporting, generate report.</li>
<li>If policy invalid and policy specifies rejection, perform the following steps:  <br>
a.  Check for a new (non-cached) _authenticated_policy.  If one exists, update the current policy and go to step 1. <br>
b.  If none exists or the newly fetched policy also fails, treat the delivery as a failure. Understanding the details of step 4 is critical to understanding the behavior of the system as a whole.</li></ol></li>
</ul>

<p>Remember that each policy has an expiration time (which may be long, on the order of months) and a validation method.  With these two mechanisms and the procedure specified in step 4, recipients who publish a policy have, in effect, a means of updating a cached policy at arbitrary intervals, without the risks (of a man-in-the-middle attack) they would incur if they were to shorten the policy expiration time.</p>
